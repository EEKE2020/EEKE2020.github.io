        <h2 align="left">Aim of the Workshop</h2>
        <p align="justify">In the era of big data, massive amounts of information and data have dramatically changed human civilization. The broad availability of information provides more opportunities for people, but there has appeared a new challenge: how can we obtain useful knowledge from numerous information sources. A knowledge entity is a relatively independent and integral knowledge module in a  special discipline or a research domain [1]. As a crucial medium for  knowledge transmission, scientific documents that contain a large number of  knowledge entities attract the attention of scholars [2]. In  scientific documents, knowledge entities refer to the   knowledge mentioned or  cited by authors, such as algorithms, models, theories, datasets and software, which reflect the various resources used by the authors in solving problems.  Extracting knowledge entities from scientific documents in an accurate and  comprehensive way becomes a significant topic. We may recommend documents related to a given knowledge entity (e.g. LSTM model) for scholars, especially for beginners in a research field. DARPA has recently launched the ASKE (Automating  Scientific Knowledge Extraction) project [3], which aims to   develop  next-generation applications of artificial intelligence. <br>
        Therefore,  the goal of this workshop is to engage the related communities in open problems in the extraction and evaluation of   knowledge entities from scientific  documents.  At present, scholars have used knowledge entities to construct general knowledge-graphs [4] and domain knowledge-graphs [5].  Data sources for these studies include text (news, policy files, email, etc.)  and multimedia (video, image, etc.) data. Compared to existing research and workshops like Joint workshop on Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval  and Natural Language Processing for Digital Libraries (BIRNDL) [6] or  Workshop on Mining Scientific Publications (WOSP) [7], this workshop aims to  extract knowledge entities from scientific   documents, and explore the feature of entities to conduct practical applications. The results of this workshop are expected to provide scholars, especially early career researchers, with  knowledge recommendations and other knowledge entity-based services. </p>

        <h2 align="left">Workshop Topics</h2>
        <p align="justify">This workshop will be relevant to scholars in computer and information science, specialized in Information Extraction, Text Mining, NLP, IR and Digital  Libraries. It will also be of importance for all stakeholders in the  publication pipeline: implementers, publishers and policymakers. This workshop entitles this cutting-edge and cross-disciplinary direction <em>Extraction and Evaluation of Knowledge Entity</em>, highlighting the development of  intelligent methods for identifying knowledge claims in scientific documents, and promoting the application of knowledge entities. We invite stimulating  research on topics including, but not limited to, methods of knowledge entity  extraction and applications of knowledge entity.

		<strong>Entitymetrics 2.0: Measuring the Impact of Entities and Relations Extracted from Scientific Documents</strong> [<a href="slides/entitymetrics_presentation.ppt">slides</a>]</p>
	<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>: Since the concept of entitymetrics was first introduced in 2013, entitymetrics has been applied to measure the impact of entities as well as to gauge the knowledge usage and transfer anchored on entities for knowledge discovery. This concept extends informetrics by quantifying the importance of various types of entities such as concept, dataset, and domain entities buried in a large amount of full-text collections. Entitymetrics uses entities for knowledge usage as well as discovery. We claim that it is the next generation of content-based citation analysis in that it aims to utilize entities to create a knowledge graph for scientific discovery where entities are connected to each other either by citation or predicate relation. In this talk, the previous studies employing entitiymetrics are summarized and the limitations of the current approaches are discussed. In addition, the future directions of entitymetrics are suggested.<br><br>

		<strong>Building Scholarly Knowledge Bases with Crowdsourcing and Text Mining</strong></p>
	<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>: For centuries, scholarly knowledge has been buried in documents. While articles are great to convey the story of scientific work to peers, they make it hard for machines to process scholarly knowledge. The recent proliferation of the scholarly literature and the increasing inability of researchers to digest, reproduce, reuse its content are constant reminders that we urgently need a transformative digitalization of the scholarly literature. Building on the Open Research Knowledge Graph (http://orkg.org) as a concrete research infrastructure, in this talk we present how using crowdsourcing and text mining humans and machines can collaboratively build scholarly knowledge bases, i.e. systems that acquire, curate and publish data, information and knowledge published in the scholarly literature in structured and semantic form. We discuss some key challenges that human and technical infrastructures face as well as the possibilities scholarly knowledge bases enable. </span><br>

	<h2 align="left">Call for Papers</h2>
    <p align="justify">You are invited to participate in the <strong>1st Workshop on Extraction and Evaluation of Knowledge Entities from Scientific Documents (EEKE2020)</strong>, to be held as part of the ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries 2020 in Wuhan, China on August 1, 2020.</p>
    <p align="justify"><a href="https://eeke2020.github.io/">https://eeke2020.github.io/</a></p>
        <h2 align="left">Submission Information</h2>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Regular papers</strong>: All submissions must be written in English, following the <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM Proceedings template</a> (10 pages for <strong>full papers</strong> and 4 pages for <strong>short papers</strong> exclusive of unlimited pages for references) and should be submitted as PDF files to <a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=eeke2020">EasyChair</a>.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Poster &amp; demonstration</strong>: We welcome submissions     detailing original, early findings, works in progress and industrial     applications of knowledge entities extraction ande evaluation for a     special poster session, possibly with a 2-minute presentation in the     main session. Some research track papers will also be invited to the     poster track instead, although there will be no difference in the final     proceedings between poster and research track submissions. These   papers   should follow the same format as the research track papers but   can be   shorter (2 pages for <strong>poster and demo papers</strong>).</p>
        <h3 align="justify"> <a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=eeke2020" target="_new">Submit a paper</a></h3>
        <p align="justify"> All submissions will be reviewed by at least two independent  reviewers. Please be aware of the fact that at least   one author per paper needs to   register for the workshop and   attend the workshop to present the work. In light of the recent events regarding the Coronavirus, EEKE2020 will be an all-virtual workshop as JCDL will be online only. </p>
        <p align="justify">Workshop proceedings will be deposited online in the CEUR workshop     proceedings publication service. This way the  proceedings will be   permanently available and citable (digital   persistent identifiers and   long term preservation).</p>
        <h2 align="left">Important Dates</h2>
        <p align="justify">All dates are Anywhere on Earth (AoE).</p>
        <p align="justify">Deadline for submission: <font color=red><strong>June 22, 2020 (extended)</strong></font><br>
          Notification of acceptance: July 14, 2020<br>
