<p class="Heading">JCDL2020 Workshop:  Extraction and Evaluation of Knowledge Entities from Scientific Documents  (EEKE2020)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the era of big data, massive amounts of  information and data have
 dramatically changed human civilization. The broad availability  of 
information provides more opportunities for people, but there has 
appeared a  new challenge: how can we obtain useful knowledge from 
numerous information sources. <br>
&nbsp; A  knowledge entity is a relatively independent and integral 
knowledge module in a  special discipline or a research domain [1]. As a
 crucial medium for  knowledge transmission, scientific documents that 
contain a large number of  knowledge entities attract the attention of 
scholars [2]. In  scientific documents, knowledge entities refer to the 
knowledge mentioned or  cited by authors, such as algorithms, models, 
theories, datasets and software,  which reflect the various resources 
used by the authors in solving problems.  Extracting knowledge entities 
from scientific documents in an accurate and  comprehensive way becomes a
 significant topic. We may recommend documents  related to a given 
knowledge entity (e.g. LSTM model) for scholars, especially for  
beginners in a research field. DARPA has recently launched the ASKE 
(Automating  Scientific Knowledge Extraction) project [3], which aims to
 develop  next-generation applications of artificial intelligence. <br>
&nbsp; Therefore,  the goal of this workshop is to engage the related 
communities in open problems  in the extraction and evaluation of 
knowledge entities from scientific  documents.<br>
At present, scholars have used knowledge  entities to construct general 
knowledge-graphs [4] and domain knowledge-graphs [5].  Data sources for 
these studies include text (news, policy files, email, etc.)  and 
multimedia (video, image, etc.) data. Compared to existing research and 
 workshops like Joint workshop on Bibliometric-enhanced Information 
Retrieval  and Natural Language Processing for Digital Libraries 
(BIRNDL) [6] or  Workshop on Mining Scientific Publications (WOSP) [7], 
this workshop aims to  extract knowledge entities from scientific 
documents, and explore the feature  of entities to conduct practical 
applications. The results of this workshop are  expected to provide 
scholars, especially early career researchers, with  knowledge 
recommendations and other knowledge entity-based services. This  
workshop will be relevant to scholars in computer and information 
science,  specialized in Information Extraction, Text Mining, NLP, IR 
and Digital  Libraries. It will also be of importance for all 
stakeholders in the  publication pipeline: implementers, publishers and 
policymakers.<br>
This workshop entitles this cutting-edge and  cross-disciplinary direction <em>Extraction  and Evaluation of Knowledge Entity</em>,
 highlighting the development of  intelligent methods for identifying 
knowledge claims in scientific documents,  and promoting the application
 of knowledge entities. We invite stimulating  research on topics 
including, but not limited to, methods of knowledge entity  extraction 
and applications of knowledge entity. Specific examples of fields of  
interest include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Model  and algorithmize entity extraction from scientific documents </li>
  <li>Dataset  and metrics mention extraction from scientific documents </li>
  <li>Software  and tool extraction from scientific documents [8] </li>
  <li>Construction  of a knowledge entity graph and roadmap [9]</li>
  <li>Knowledge  entity summarization </li>
  <li>Relation  extraction of knowledge entity </li>
  <li>Construction  of a knowledge base of knowledge entities</li>
  <li>Bibliometrics  of knowledge entity</li>
  <li>Application  of knowledge entity extraction</li>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The  workshop will last two half-days and specific  activities 
include keynotes, paper presentations and a poster session. We plan  to 
invite around 20 registered people in the workshop. The tentative number
 of attendees  is 60. The attendees will obtain relevant information 
through Website CFP, and  notifications via emails and social media.</p>

<p><strong>Tentative  Schedule of Events</strong><br>
  Along with research paper presentation  (long and short), the workshop
 will host one or two keynotes and a poster  session. The workshop will 
end with planning and discussions to decide on  future directions and 
improvements to the workshop.</p>
<p><strong>Diversity  and Inclusion at EEKE</strong>. EEKE aims to be  
inclusive and diverse, in terms of both constituency and research. To 
this end,  the open CfP will explicitly encourage female first authors 
and  underrepresented groups.</p>
